  Our current vision entails developing a music player system that offers an interactive 
  and dynamic approach to music creation. Written in Ocaml, our platform enables users to 
  play music live by simply pressing keys on the keyboard, facilitating real-time composition. 
  With the ability to overlay tracks seamlessly, users can effortlessly produce complex pieces. 
  Additionally, the system includes essential features such as a metronome for timing precision, 
  as well as support for chord progressions and dynamics. Furthermore, users will have access 
  to a variety of instruments, looping capabilities, and playback features, enhancing the 
  versatility and creative potential of the platform. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive 
  and user-friendly solution that caters to musicians of all levels, fostering creativity 
  and exploration in music-making.
